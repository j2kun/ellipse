# Ellipse

This is a pure Python 3.7 library for doing basic geometry on ellipses.
I wanted to centralize the formulas for a different project, because I
tend to mix up sines, cosines, and signs.

Currently it supports

 - parametric evaluation on boundary points
 - point tests
 - bounding box computation

Future things to support, though I have no need for them right now:

 - intersection of two ellipses
 - smallest ellipse containing a set of points
 - best fit ellipse for a set of points
